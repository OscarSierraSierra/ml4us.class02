        This site uses backtests to study the accuracy and effectiveness of simple machine learning models on S &amp; P 500 data.


      %p
        If a backtest suggests that a model issues effective predictions on past data, obviously that does not mean the model can predict the future.

      %p
        If, however, a model issues ineffective predictions on past data, I would not want to use that model to predict future S &amp; P 500 behavior.
